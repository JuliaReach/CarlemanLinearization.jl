This package implements the Carleman linearization transformation of polynomial
differential equations in Julia.

## Features

The following methods are available:

- Construction of the Carleman embedding using sparse matrices
- Explicit error bounds [ForetsP17](@cite)
- Improved error bounds for dissipative systems [ForetsP17](@cite)

## Example

```julia
using CarlemanLinearization

....
```
